I’m excited to share my recent project where I developed a dynamic **WhatsApp bot** using the **WhatsApp Cloud API**! 🎉  

The bot is designed to interact seamlessly with users through **interactive buttons**, making conversations more intuitive and efficient. Here's a quick breakdown of what the bot does:  

🔹 **Features**:  
- Asks users what they’d like to order (e.g., Tea, Coffee, or Bread Slices) with clickable button options.  
- Dynamically follows up based on the user's selection (e.g., "How many cups/slices?").  
- Sends a personalized confirmation message once the order is placed.  

🔹 **Tech Stack**:  
- **Node.js** for backend logic  
- **Express.js** to handle the webhook  
- **Axios** for making API calls to the WhatsApp Cloud API  

🔹 **Challenges & Learnings**:  
- Setting up the webhook and ensuring real-time interactions was both a challenge and a rewarding learning experience.  
- Handling dynamic user states efficiently was key to creating a smooth user experience.  

🔹 **Use Case**:  
This bot can be a game-changer for small businesses looking to automate order-taking or customer service through WhatsApp!  

💡 Exploring automation in messaging platforms like WhatsApp has been an insightful journey. If you're looking to automate workflows or build something similar, let’s connect and brainstorm!
